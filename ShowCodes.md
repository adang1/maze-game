## Show Code #2 (4 of 4 points)

Code compiles and runs almost as desired. The enemy is moving through walls, but other than that the
functionality is okay. We could clean up the players movement code a bit. That would allow the player
to get closer to walls and then similar code could be used for the enemy.
