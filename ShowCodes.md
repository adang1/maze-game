Code compiles and runs almost as desired. The enemy is moving through walls, but other than that the

to get closer to walls and then similar code could be used for the enemy.

Code compiles and runs. You still need to make it so the entities interact and there appear to be some bugs
in how the shooting of the projectiles works, but shortest path seemed to be solid.
